# MetaCacheDatabase (MCDB) setup

The MetaCacheDatabase (MCDB) feature is included in Exchange Server 2019. It allows a database availability group (DAG) to be accelerated by utilizing solid state disks (SSDs). `Manage-MetaCacheDatabase.ps1` is an automation script created for Exchange Server administrators to set up and manage MCDB instances in their Exchange 2019 DAGs.

After installing Exchange Server 2019, you can find `Manage-MetaCacheDatabase.ps1` here: ***drive*:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V15\\Scripts**. To make the **Manage-MCDB** CMDLet available in your Exchange Management Shell session, do the following:

```PowerShell
cd $exscripts
. .\Manage-MetaCacheDatabase.ps1
```

You use this script to configure MCDB prerequisites on a properly configured DAG, to enable or disable MCDB, and to configure and repair MCDB on your servers.

## SSD guidance

All SSDs used for MCDB need to be of the same capacity and type. A symmetrical configuration between servers is required, which means there needs to be an identical number of SSDs in each server, and the SSDs all need to be the same size.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Manage-MCDB** cmdlet will only work with devices exposed as **MediaType SSD** by Windows.

It is recommended to target a 1:3 ratio between SSD and HDD devices per server. Therefore, deploy one SSD for every three HDDs. In order to avoid having to reduce the number of HDDs in the server, consider using M.2 form factor SSDs.

Providing 5% to 6% of SSD capacity relative to total HDD capacity is sufficient for on-premises deployments. For example, if your server contains 100 TB of HDD capacity for mailbox databases, an allocation of 5 TB to 6 TB for SSD capacity is enough.

The SSDs you use should qualify for "mixed use" and support one drive write per day (DWPD) or greater in terms of write endurance.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required for successful configuration and use of MCDB:

1. The DAG is configured for AutoReseed.

   For more information, see the following topics:

   - [AutoReseed](autoreseed.md)

   - [Configure AutoReseed for a database availability group](../manage-ha/configure-dag-autoreseed.md)

2. RAW SSD drives are installed with the same SSD count and size for each server in the DAG. Make sure that all SSDs are completely empty, unformatted, and not write-protected. To verify this, you can use use [DiskPart](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/diskpart) or [Clear-Disk](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/storage/clear-disk?view=win10-ps).

3. Exchange Server 2019.

## MCDB setup

The process of setting up MCDB can be broken down into four basic steps:

1. Set the correct values for the DAG you want to enable for MCDB.

2. Update Active Directory (AD) settings and wait for propagation (by running `ConfigureMCDBPrerequisite`).

3. Allow MCDB acceleration for each server of the DAG (by running `ServerAllowMCDB`).

4. Create the necessary infrastructure (Volumes, Mount Points) for MCDB on each server (by running `ConfigureMCDBOnServer`).

5. Let databases fail over to pick up the new settings.

After successful execution of all four steps, MCDB acceleration will begin for every database instance with a corresponding MCDB instance.

The following sections describe how to utilize the `Manage-MetaCacheDatabase.ps1` script to achieve the above four steps.

### Step 1: Configure proper values on the DAG you want to enable MCDB for

These DAG parameters are used to calculate the proper MCDB size on your SSD drives:

- *AutoDagTotalNumberOfDatabases*: Maximum number of possible active database copies per server that will use MCDB.

- *AutoDagDatabaseCopiesPerDatabase*: The number of active and passive copies each individual database has.

- *AutoDagTotalNumberOfServers*: The amount of servers within your DAG, so between 2 and 16.

For example:

```PowerShell
Set-DatabaseAvailabilityGroup testdag1 -AutoDagTotalNumberOfDatabases 20 -AutoDagDatabaseCopiesPerDatabase 4 -AutoDagTotalNumberOfServers 8
```

### Step 2: Run Manage-MCDB -ConfigureMCDBPrerequisite

This parameter sets the Active Directory state for the DAG object. Full replication of the Active Directory state is required before MCDB can function properly on all servers.

**ParameterSetIdentifier**:

- _ConfigureMCDBPrerequisite_

**Parameters**:

|Parameter|Required|Description|
|:-------|:--------|:--------|
|DagName|True|Name of the Database availability group.|
|SSDSizeInBytes|True|The capacity in bytes of each SSD in the server to be used for MCDB.|
|SSDCountPerServer|True|The count of SSD devices to be utilize for MCDB in each server.|

**Scope**:

- **DAG**: _ConfigureMCDBPrerequisite_ operates on a DAG object.

> [!NOTE]
> MCDB will utilize up to 95% of an SSD's physical capacity. The remaining 5% is kept free to account for file system and partition overhead, as well as for a small amount of additional buffer and over-provisioning.

**Example**:

```PowerShell
Manage-MCDB -DagName TestDag1 -ConfigureMCDBPrerequisite -SSDSizeInBytes 5242880000 -SSDCountPerServer 2
```

### Step 3: Run Manage-MCDB -ServerAllowMCDB

This command sets the local state on each DAG member to allow/disallow MCDB population and read acceleration.

**ParameterSetIdentifier**:

- _ServerAllowMCDB_

**Parameters**:

| Parameter|Required|Description|
|:-------|:-----|:---|
|DagName|True|Name of the Database availability group.|
|ServerName|True|Specifies the server to enable MetaCacheDatabase on.|
|ForceFailover|Optional|This Boolean switch can be utilized to cause all databases on a server to fail over. This is required to make all configuration changes take effect and to begin utilizing MCDB after mount points and database instances have been successfully created in [Step 4: Run Manage-MCDB -ConfigureMCDBOnServer](#step-4-run-manage-mcdb--configuremcdbonserver). It is also needed to disable SSD acceleration.|

**Scope**:

- **Server**: You need to run _ServerAllowMCDB_ on each server in the DAG.

**Examples**:

```PowerShell
Manage-MCDB -DagName TestDag1 -ServerAllowMCDB:$true -ServerName "exhs-5046"
```

```PowerShell
Manage-MCDB -DagName TestDag1 -ServerAllowMCDB:$false -ServerName "exhs-5046" -ForceFailover $true
```

![MCDB run ServerAllowMCDB](../../media/mcdb2.png)

### Step 4: Run Manage-MCDB -ConfigureMCDBOnServer

This command identifies unformatted SSD devices and formats them, and also creates the necessary mount points on a server for hosting MCDB instances. This parameter set can also be used to re-create mount points on a raw SSD that was added to replace a failed SSD.

**ParameterSetIdentifier**:

- _ConfigureMCDBOnServer_

**Parameters**:

|Parameter|Required|Description|
|:-------|:--------|:--------|
|DagName|True|Name of the Database availability group.|
|ServerName|True|Specifies the server to identify unformatted SSD devices and create mount points on.|
|SSDSizeInBytes|True|This is the capacity, in bytes, of each SSD in the server to be used for MCDB.|

**Scope**:

- **Server**: You need to run _ConfigureMCDBOnServer_ on each server in the DAG.

Example:

```PowerShell
Manage-MCDB -DagName TestDag1 -ConfigureMCDBOnServer -ServerName "exhs-4056" -SSDSizeInBytes 5242880000
```

![Run MCDBOnServer1](../../media/mcdb3.png)

![Run MCDBOnServer2](../../media/mcdb4.png)

After performing the previous three steps (configuring _ConfigureMCDBPrerequisite_, _ServerAllowMCDB_, and _ConfigureMCDBOnServer_), the MCDB state will display as **Storage Offline**. This means that the environment is prepared and ready for MCDB instances to be created and populated. The next fail over of the database instance will cause the creation of the MCDB instance and enable acceleration. The instances will transition through the health states shown in [MCDB health states](#mcdb-health-states).

You can use the _ServerAllowMCDB_ parameter set to cause fail overs of all DB instances present on a given server. Alternatively, you can use the **Move-ActiveMailboxDatabase** cmdlet to cause individual databases to fail over.

```PowerShell
Manage-MCDB -DagName TestDag1 -ServerAllowMCDB:$true -ServerName "exhs-5046" -ForceFailover $true
```

## MCDB health states

Use **Get-MailboxDatabaseCopyStatus** to query the state of the MCDB instances. There are five states that an MCDB instance can be in, as shown in the following table:

|State|Description|
|:------|:------|
| Disabled|MCDB is turned off.|
|StorageOffline|Basic infrastructure is missing or inaccessible, such as mount points or file paths. This is the state MCDB is in following an SSD failure.|
|Offline|Errors at the logical level, for example missing MCDB instances.|
|Initializing|Transient state, the system is determining what other state it should be in.|
|Healthy|Ready to serve requests.|
